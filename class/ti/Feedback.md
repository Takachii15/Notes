# Introduction

# Role of feedback in Communication

- correct receiver misunderstanding ?
- predict and correct the noise ? 
- cooperate with other senders ?
- determine properties of the channel ?
- reduce communication delay ? 
- reduce computational complexity at the transmitter or the receiver and improve communication rate ? 

# Feedback for memmoryless channel

let's assume there is a system where there is an transmitter(x) and a receiver(y), and the conditional mass function of the system is p(y|x). if one wish
to use this channel n times, then
